                <p>Purchase your Nicolai Remy timepiece with peace of mind. Our goal when creating this company was to leave the world a better place than we found it. We emphasize sustainability and social responsibility over shareholder profit.</p>
                <p>Nicolai Remy was founded by two engineers as an experiment to challenge well-established studios with experienced directors and a bottomless marketing budget. As bright-eyed college graduates, we care more about making a global impact than churning a few dollars. We fell in love with Tom’s sustainability campaign - for each shoe they sell, a person in need receives an identical product. Realizing the need for watches may not be as great in the developing countries, we decided to make our impact with a different strategy.</p>
                <p>100% of net profits will be used to improve the world. This could mean purchasing a hearing aid for a child in need; the money could also be used to construct emergency shelters in the wake of natural disasters. We’ll let you decide.</p>
                <p>Every fiscal year, we will release a detailed transparency report of inventory costs, warehousing fees, advertising, salaries paid, etc. (literally everything!). In big bold letters we will show you our net profit - all of it goes to making the world a better place.</p>
                <p>Not enough? We purchase carbon credits for each watch we sell to offset the pollution that may have been created during our manufacturing process. Finally, our web servers are powered by 100% clean energy from wind and geothermal processes.</p>
                <p>Join us in this journey...</p>
