                <p>The Nicolai Remy design studio was founded in 2015 to experiment with minimalism in fashion accessories. With strong influences from the bauhaus design movement and our generation’s fascination with the “less is more” ideas of minimalism, we desire to provide subtle yet bold additions to your wardrobe.</p>
                <p>The watchface is designed in Oklahoma City - our objective was to keep lettering as non-invasive as possible, yet maintain a powerful brand that our customers’ peers would easily recognize. We chose to place only two sans-serif letters on the dial - where most watch companies have gotten accustomed to writing ‘Quartz’.</p>
                <p>The bands of our timepieces are imported and what give Nicolai Remy timepieces their unique modern flair. The imported NATO-style nylon bands give you an endless selection of how you want to emphasize your wardrobe. Whether you choose to match your pocket square or add an additional accent color to your outfit, your Remy watch is sure to catch eyes. For a completely classical feel, put on a Camden-series chronograph with a leather band and control the board room!</p>
                <p>We price our timepieces competitively as a means to challenge “fashion companies” who charged outrageously for a quartz movement. Our founders strongly believed that a watch with no complications and ran on a battery could be offered at a price point where it made sense to buy a second watch instead of a different colored band.</p>
